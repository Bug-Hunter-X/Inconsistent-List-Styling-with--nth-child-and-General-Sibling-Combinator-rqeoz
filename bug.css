The following CSS code snippet intends to style a list element, but it will not render correctly due to an uncommon error involving the `:nth-child` pseudo-class and a sibling selector.

```css
li:nth-child(2n+1) ~ li {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

This code attempts to target every odd list item and apply a yellow background. However, `~` (general sibling combinator) selects only siblings that appear *after* the selected element.  Therefore, it doesn't select every other item; it only selects siblings following an odd-numbered element.  This leads to inconsistent styling.
