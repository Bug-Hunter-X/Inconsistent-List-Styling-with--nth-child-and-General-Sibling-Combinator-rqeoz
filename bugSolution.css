The corrected CSS code uses `:nth-child(2n)` to directly target even list items, producing the intended alternating background colors:

```css
li:nth-child(2n) {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
This accurately styles every other list item without the unexpected behavior caused by the general sibling combinator.
